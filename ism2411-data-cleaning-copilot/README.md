Data Cleaning with CoPilot

This program can import a .csv file from the data/raw/ folder and run a Python program to clean it as a datafram and return a new .csv file in the folder data/processed/. This is a good tool intended for use as a rudimentary file organizer to prepare information for sharing or data manipulation. This program was assisted by using GitHub CoPilot, with changes to functions and additions to debug and prevent errors.

To run the program, you will need Python installed on your computer. In the files, attach a .csv file of your choice to the folder data > raw.
